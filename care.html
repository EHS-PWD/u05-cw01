        <h2>Enclosure</h2>
        <p>
          Provide a spacious enclosure with a substrate suitable for digging,
          such as topsoil or coconut coir. Ensure the enclosure is secure to
          prevent escapes.

        <h2>Diet</h2>
        <p>
          Russian tortoises are herbivores. Feed them a variety of leafy greens
          like kale, collard greens, and dandelion greens. Avoid fruits and
          high-protein foods.

        <h2>Health</h2>
        <p>
          Keep the environment clean and provide access to UVB light to maintain
          their health. Regularly check for signs of illness, such as lethargy
          or swollen eyes.
